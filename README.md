**Fed-EALA: Efficient Authentication With Lightweight Encryption for Federated Learning in Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks Using SSI**

This repository contains the official implementation of the Fed-EALA framework proposed in our paper. Fed-EALA is designed for secure and efficient identity authentication in **Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs)** under a **Federated Learning (FL)** architecture, leveraging **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)** principles.

## 🔐 Overview

In VANET-based federated learning, identity authentication plays a critical role in preventing Sybil attacks and ensuring trust between participating vehicles.  
**Fed-EALA** introduces an authentication framework.
